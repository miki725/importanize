* Added pipe handling (e.g. ``cat foo.py | importanize``)
* Fixed bug which incorrectly sorted imports with aliases (e.g. ``import foo as bar``)

  flag or can be set in the configuration file.

* Fixes a bug where wildcard leaf imports were combined with other others
  (see `#25 <https://github.com/miki725/importanize/issues/25/>`_ for example)

0.3 (2015-01-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Using tokens to parse Python files. As a result this allows to
  fix how comments are handled
  (see `#21 <https://github.com/miki725/importanize/issues/21>`_ for example)

0.2 (2014-10-30)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  instead of exiting
* Multiple imports with the same stem are combined into
  single import statement

0.1.3 (2014-09-15)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed where single line triple-quote docstrings would cause
  none of the imports to be recognized
